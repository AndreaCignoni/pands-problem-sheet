#                       <center> Bank.py</center> 

**Bank.py sums 2 amounts in cent and convert them into Euro**

My main point of reference for learning how to request an input from a user was [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_user_input.asp)

#                        Collatz.py 

**This array triggers the collatz calculation and stops the final 4-1-0 loop**

**Week.py says whether current day is a weekday or a weekend**

#                         SquareRoot.py

#                        Es.py 

**this program open a text file reads it and count the number of letter 'e' contained in the text**
