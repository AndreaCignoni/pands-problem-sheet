#                       <center> Helloworld.py</center>

**This program says "Hello World!"**

A “Hello world!” program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language. This sentence is a string, and a string is a sequence of characters. We create a string by wrapping a sequence of characters in quotation marks. Even a single character is considered a string. In Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they are created. As a consequence, if you try to change any value in a string, it will throw an error. You must create a new string inorder to incorporate the changes.
To represent a string, you wrap it within quotes. There can be multiple ways of doing this:

-Single quotes that allow you to embed "double" quotes in your string.'
*Double quotes that allow you to embed 'single' quotes in your string.
+Triple quotes that allow to embed "double quotes" as well as 'single quotes' in your string. 

Strings can also span across multiple lines

#                       <center> Bank.py</center> 

**Bank.py sums 2 amounts in cent and convert them into Euro**

 In this task, I took two numbers, "number1" and "number2", adding them together and then devides the sum by 100. The output prints out converted value into Euro.


#                        Accounts.py 

**This program returns a masked account number with X showing the last 4 digits only**

Here, I have put into practice three basic methods: inputing, concatenating strings and outputing slices of code.

My main point of reference for learning how to request an input from a user was [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_user_input.asp)

#                        Collatz.py 

**This array triggers the collatz calculation and stops the final 4-1-0 loop**


#                        Weekday.py 

**Week.py says whether current day is a weekday or a weekend**

#                         SquareRoot.py 

**This program receives any number and returns its square root using the Newman method**

The square_root() function takes a number as an input, sets a level of accuracy for the approximation, assigns the input number to a variable k, and initializes an initial guess for the square root to be half the input number.


#                        Es.py 

**this program open a text file reads it and count the number of letter 'e' contained in the text**
